## Get Next Line

**This project for school 42 aims at creating a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.**
The bonuses allow the use of several file descriptors. 
The key concept of the project is the use of a static variable.

The program must be compiled as follows: 
```
gcc - Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
```
